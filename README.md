# Lab 1 – JavaScript Conditionals & Loops

This lab includes 8 JavaScript exercises, with each exercise placed in its own file within the `js/` directory.


## How to Run the code
- In a browser, open `index.html`.
- Enable only one <script> tag at a time in index.html.
- Disable all other script tags to prevent multiple scripts from running simultaneously.
- Refresh the page to view the results.

## Output
- Exercises use `alert()` / `prompt()` for user interaction.
- Looping exercises output results to the browser console (`console.log()`).
